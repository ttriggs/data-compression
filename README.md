Huffman Coding algorithm to turn text into binary and back

This is a WIP. 
Correctly functioning: 
- binary tree is created correctly and writing ASCII binary ("1","0") can correctly code & decode a text file 

To do: 
- continue experimenting with methods of writing the binary tree info into actual binary data file rather than text file of ASCII binary characters.
